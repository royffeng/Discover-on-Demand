# Discover-on-Demand

## About
 - Originally inspired by Obscurify, the site that gave my beliefs that I had a quirky and unique taste in music a reality check. I confidently agreed to let Obscurify access my account and was sorely disappointed when their breakdown page told me that my favorite music was tragically basic. Since then, I have vowed to listen to each Discover Weekly and *Made for you* playlist that Spotify's algorithms painstakingly create for me. Soon, I realized it wasn't enough.
 - One of the most frustrating things as someone who now loves finding new music is having to wait for your Discover Weekly playlist to refresh on Sunday at 8:59pm PST. With Disover on Demand, I have eliminated the weekly wait and can instantly browse recommended categories, playlists, and new releases based off current Spotify streaming data.
